## NQueens, ModuleLoader, and WeatherTrack Projects

### Overview
This repository contains three distinct projects:  

- **NQueens Solver**: A C++ solution for the N-Queens problem, finding all valid placements of queens on an NxN chessboard.  
- **ModuleLoader**: A C++ program to detect circular dependencies in a directed graph of modules.  
- **WeatherTrack**: An Android app to display and manage mock weather data for Vijayawada with a weekly summary.

## Project Details

### 1. NQueens Solver

#### Description
Solves the classic N-Queens problem, where N queens must be placed on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens attack each other (no shared row, column, or diagonal).

#### Features
- Accepts user input for board size N (1 to 9)
- Uses backtracking to find all valid queen placements
- Displays each solution as a board with `'Q'` for queens and `'.'` for empty cells

#### Key Components

- **NQueensSolver Class**:
  - `solveNQueens(int n)`: Public method to initiate solving and return all solutions
  - `placeQueens`: Recursive function using backtracking to place queens row by row
  - `isSafe`: Checks if a queen can be placed at a position without conflicts

- **Main Function**:
  - Takes user input for N
  - Prints total number of solutions and each board configuration

### 2. ModuleLoader

#### Description
A C++ program to detect circular dependencies in a directed graph, useful for scenarios like module or software dependency analysis.

#### Features
- Takes a number of nodes (n) and a list of edges (dependencies)
- Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify cycles
- Outputs `true` for cyclic dependencies, `false` otherwise

#### Key Components

- **ModuleLoader Class**:
  - `hasCircularDependency(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges)`: Builds a graph and checks for cycles
  - `dfsHasCycle`: Recursive DFS to detect back edges indicating a cycle

- **State Tracking**:
  - Uses a state vector: `0` (unvisited), `1` (visiting), `2` (visited)

- **Main Function**:
  - Tests two sample cases: one without a cycle, one with a cycle

### 3. WeatherTrack

#### Description
An Android app that displays daily weather for Vijayawada using mock data, stores it in a Room database, and provides a weekly summary. Background updates run periodically.

#### Features
- Displays current weather: temperature (Â°C), humidity (%), and condition
- "Refresh Weather" button fetches new mock data
- "View Weekly Summary" shows a 7-day weather history
- Background updates every 6 hours via WorkManager

#### Key Components

- **MainActivity**:
  - Shows current weather via TextViews
  - Buttons for refresh and summary navigation
  - Observes LiveData for updates

- **SummaryActivity**:
  - Displays a scrollable 7-day summary from the database

- **WeatherRepository**:
  - Reads mock data from `weather_mock.json` in `assets`
  - Saves to Room database with timestamps

- **WeatherViewModel**:
  - Manages UI data with LiveData

- **WeatherWorker**:
  - Periodic background updates using WorkManager

- **WeatherDatabase & WeatherDao**:
  - Stores and queries weather data (`WeatherEntity`)

- **Layouts**:
  - `activity_main.xml`: LinearLayout for current weather
  - `activity_summary.xml`: ScrollView for summary

## Notes

- Uses mock JSON data mapped to the current day
- Persists data in Room for offline access
- No real API; assumes Vijayawada as the city
